# Waiei Custom Judgement Fonts
A custom function for Waiei CitMin that expands the usable judgment labels.

To add new judgment labels, go to `Customs\JudgmentSetting\Screen system\default.lua`, and in the `Key = 'JudgmentMode'` list, add whatever ones you want after the final one in the list. Then, go to `Graphics\ScreenGameplay\judgment`, and add your judgment label. Make sure it ends in `1x6.png`, or `1x6 (doubleres).png`, depending on if the original judgment graphic is doubleres or not.

As per the Waiei guidelines, DO **NOT** use this to add official DDR/ITG/StepManiaX judgment fonts to the theme.
